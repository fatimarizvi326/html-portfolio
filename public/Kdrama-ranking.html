<h3>The King Eternal Monarch</h3>
<p>This drama is about two parallel worlds and 
    time travel. I like this drama because it has
    alot og genre like romance, sci-fi, action,
    mystery, drama and crime. The direction
    and cinematography of this drama is very well 
    done. Alot of people find it difficult to 
    understand and get confused because of different
    worlds and time travel. But it truely is one of
    my favourite Kdrama. It is very 
    well made. </p>

    <p>This drama is a fantasy based. Again it is 
    best for alot of reasons, it has one of the best
    cinematography effect. The story is very well 
    written. It is a package of action, magic, 
    mystery, romance and comedy. </p>

    <h3>What's wrong with secretary kim</h3>
    <p>This drama is a romcom. It's very refresh,
     both the leads have very good chemistry. It has
     balance of romance, comedy. The male lead has 
     sassy character and he portray it very well.</p>

     <h3>Business Proposal</h3>
     <p>This drama is also my one of favourite. It is a romcom. Both the male and female leads  have their owm uniqueness and have great chemistry. Even the second lead of this drama 
     is so good and one of my favourite second lead.
